# MAGDA

Multi Agent Generative DAW API

MAGDA is an AI-driven system that translates natural language prompts into generic DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) commands. For example:

Prompt: create a track for bass and one for drum, use serum for the bass and addictive drums for the drums

MAGDA: 
track(bass, serum)
track(drums, addictive_drums)

The project will be prototyped in Python, then implemented in C++, with possible Python bindings in the future.
